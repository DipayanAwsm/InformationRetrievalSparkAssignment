# InformationRetrievalSparkAssignment
it is In formation retrieval assignment based on spark .


#Task 1

          In Spark, generate an undirected graph G with n nodes (with ids 1, … , n) and 2m directed edges
          (equivalent to m undirected edges) and save it as a text file. Instead of generating a random graph,
          try to generate one with the locality property, so that it behaves somewhat like a social network.
          You can set n = 100000 and m = 10 million, but define them in the beginning and do not
          hardcode these numbers. For the remaining tasks, load the graph in a Spark RDD, with variable
          name G, whenever required. If your machine cannot take the load of this size of data (hopefully
          that shouldn’t happen), report that and try with somewhat smaller n and m.
